Undergraduate Coding Club - Kelley Lab 2024
================
Week 3
================

This week we will be taking a look at some different tips, tricks, and features of bioinformatics code you may come across or need to write yourself. 
These tools can all be used in conjunction one another so I have structured this workshop to go through examples of how to use each tool separately before comining them in some more complicated challenges at the end.

## Data Files


## Piping (| and >)


## Variables

```

## Control Structures and Conditional Statements (if, elif, else, fi)
